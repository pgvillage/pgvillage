# Development

This works through the following steps:

1. Product Ownership

   - Why is the new feature needed
   - How much can it cost in development and operation
   - What is expected of it (availability, Open Source, support options, etc.)

2. Solution Design

   - What solutions are there
   - Which has preference

3. Proof of Concept (POC)

   - Build it in [the POC environment](https://gitlab.int.corp.com/gurus-db-team/ansible-postgres/-/blob/dev/environments/poc/hosts)

4. Automation

   - Ansible role
   - Ansible environment adjustments
   - Roll out where desired

5. Management

   - Documentation
   - Transfer to the management team
