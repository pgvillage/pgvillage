# By default, there is not configuration, because there is no "sane default" to
# set. You'll have to set it yourself. Here are a few hints.
#
# Have a look in `molecule/default/converge.yml` for an example.
# You do not need to set the state to `MASTER`, all nodes can also be set to
# `BACKUP`, in which case a random host will be selected to configure the
# virtual IP. Setting `state` to `MASTER` only initially sets that host to be
# the master. Over time, other nodes will likely become master.
#
# You can see the configure virtual IP using `ip addr list eth0`.

# keepalived_vrrp_instances:
#   # `name` defines an individual instance of the VRRP protocol running on an interface.
#   - name: VI_1
#   # `state` defines the initial state that the instance should start in.
#     state: MASTER
#   # `interface` defines the interface that VRRP runs on.
#     interface: ens192
#   # `unicast_src_ip` contains the primary address for unicasts.
#     unicast_src_ip: "192.168.1.1"
#   # `secondary_private_ip` refers the the peer's unicast address.
#     secondary_private_ip: "192.168.1.2"
#   # `virtual_router_id` is the unique identifier.
#     virtual_router_id: 51
#   # `priority` is the advertised priority.
#     priority: 255
#   # `check_status_command` will make +3 to priority if command return is 0 (optional). example:
#     check_status_command: /sbin/postfix status
#   # `authentication` specifies the information necessary for servers participating in VRRP to authenticate with each other.
#     authentication:
#       auth_type: PASS
#       auth_pass: 12345
#   # `virtual_ipaddress` defines the IP addresses (there can be multiple) that VRRP is responsible for.
#     virtual_ipaddresses:
#       - name: "192.168.122.200"
